        <h4>Recipe Description</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Cheese Filling</strong>:
                 For this classic lasagna recipe, 
                 the filling contains ricotta and 
                 parmesan with seasonings and a 
                 couple of tablespoons of parsley. 
                 No ricotta? No problem, cottage 
                 cheese works just fine in this 
                 recipe!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Meat</strong>: 
                I use both Italian sausage and 
                ground beef for great flavor. If 
                using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon 
                of fennel seeds and some Italian 
                seasoning to the meat mixture for
                flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sauce</strong>:
                To keep this sauce quick, I use 
                pasta sauce or marinara sauce 
                (it’s easy to make from scratch 
                with crushed tomatoes and canned 
                tomatoes if you’d prefer). 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spinach</strong>:
                To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out
                 most of the moisture of defrosted 
                 frozen spinach and add it along with 
                 the cheese layer.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Lasagna ingredients don’t have to be 
            limited to the ones you see here. 
            Substitute meats or different cheeses,
             or try different meat sauce variations.
